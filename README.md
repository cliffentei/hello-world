Hello World lesson in action

## Introduction

Hello! My name is **Clifford Etienne**. I am a *Software Engineering Fellow* at The Marcy Lab School. :smile: 

In my free time, I like to play video games :video_game: or do yoga :sunny:. 

Three of my favorite colors are...
- Yellow
- Black
- White
...with Yellow being my favorite color.

I like to go on [Reddit](reddit.com) sometimes.
